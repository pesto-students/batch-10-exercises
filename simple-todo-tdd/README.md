## Day 20 (TDD)

### Task

In this exercise, create a TODO application using React and Redux on the client. Use Express to create a REST api and Mongodb to store the data.

### Spec

- There should be an input box to enter tasks.

- A list showing all the todos.

- User should be able to delete or edit each todo.

### Testing

Write tests for the reducers, changes in the user interface, and anything you think is appropriate for testing. On the server side test database connection, and all the CRUD functions.

Note: It is recommended that you write tests first, commit them and then start writing the app code.
