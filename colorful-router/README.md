# Colorful Router

The goal of this exercise will be to use React Router to build an app that lets you view colors and add new colors.

### Specification:

1. As a user, I can go to `/colors` to see a list of all available colors.
2. As a user, I can click on one of the colors in my colors list and get taken to a page where I can see that color in all its glory. (The route here should be `/colors/:color`.)
3. As a user, I can click on a button to show a form that will let me add a new color. (The route here should be `/colors/new`)
4. As a user, when I submit my new color form, I am redirected to the colors index, and my new color appears at the top.

Here's an idea of what your app could look like:
