Write a function html() that can be used as a template string tag, and produces
a string in which all the interpolated pieces are escaped as HTML. Use the
supplied escapeHTML function to do the escaping.

Remember that a tag function gets an array of in-between strings as its first
argument, and then the interpolated values as further arguments.
