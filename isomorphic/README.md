## Instructions


Given two strings, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are
isomorphic if they are the same length and you can replace all occurrences
of each letter in the first string with the same letter to create the
second string.

For example,"egg" and "add" are isomorphic, replace all occurrence of
e with a and g with d. "paper" and "title" are also isomorphic.These
strings are not isomorphic: "foo" and "bar", "it" and "odd".
