Longest common subsequence problem
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest
subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).
It differs from the longest common substring problem: unlike substrings, subsequences
are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

Example
LCS for input Sequences ABCDGH and AEDFHR is ADH of length 3.
LCS for input Sequences AGGTAB and GXTXAYB is GTAB of length 4.
