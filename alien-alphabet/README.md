An alphabet is an ordered set of characters that can be used to sort words. The alphabet used for English
is ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. Given a list of sorted words, return one of the alphabets that may have been
used to sort it.

For example:
```js
// ['car', 'cat', bar', 'abc'] -> ['c', 'b', 'a', 'r']
```
