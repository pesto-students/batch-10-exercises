## Instructions

Given an integer, create a formula using the numbers 1 through
6, +, and - where each number appears once and in order such
that the formula computes to the given integer.

For example:
  21 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
-10 = 12 + 34 - 56

input: Integer

output: String of form "<number> <operator> <number>..."
        which computes to the input integer.
