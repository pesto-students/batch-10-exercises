**Hamming Distance**
The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number
of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other
words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change
one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have
transformed one string into the other. In a more general context, the Hamming
distance is one of several string metrics for measuring the edit distance
between two sequences.
