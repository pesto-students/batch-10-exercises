/*
  Create a snake game using React.
  - You should be able to control the snake using the arrow keys.
  - A piece of `food` should appear on random location withing the
  boundary once the snake eats the existing item.
  - You earn 100 points for each bite eaten.
  - The snake's body grows by 10% on every bite eaten.

  There is a gif in the root of this directory called `snake_game.gif` for reference
  on how the game works. Good luck!
