/*
* Exercise 2:
*
*  Create a `StopWatch` component that has a Start/Stop button and a Clear
*  button.
*
*  Pressing Start will start a timer and the lapsed time in
*  milliseconds should be displayed above the buttons.
*
*  Once started the Start button should change to Stop. Clicking Stop
*  will stop the timer but lapsed time will be preserved.
*
*  Clicking Start again will resume the timer from where it left off.
*
*  Clicking Clear will stop the timer if it's running and reset the lapsed time to 0.
