## Instructions

**Knuth–Morris–Pratt Algorithm**
The Knuth–Morris–Pratt string searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches
for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" T by employing the
observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient
information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination
of previously matched characters.
